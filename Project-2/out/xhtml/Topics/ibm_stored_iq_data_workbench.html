        <p class="p">Big data is a pervasive problem, not a one-time occurrence. It is easy for most companies
            to realize that big data is problematic, but it is hard to identify what problems they
            have. Big data is all about the unknown, but the unknown cannot be off limits. IBM
            StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make educated decisions with
            your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most dangerous risk into its most
            valuable asset.<img class="image" id="ibm_stored_iq_data_workbench__image_rgc_2hw_5jb" src="../Images/Stored%20IQ%20Data%20Workbench.PNG" /></p>

        <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench is a data visualization and management tool that helps you to
            actively manage your company's data. It helps you to determine how much data you have,
            where it is, who owns it, and when it was last used. When you have a clear understanding
            of your company's data landscape, IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps you take control of
            data. You can make informed decisions about your data and act on that knowledge by
            copying, copying to retention, or conducting a discovery export</p>

        <div class="p">Here are just some examples of how you can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench.<ul class="ul" id="ibm_stored_iq_data_workbench__ul_qks_lyw_sjb">
                <li class="li">You need to find all company email that is sent from or received by Eileen
                    Sideways (esideways@thecompany.com). You can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to
                    find all email and then copy that data to a predefined repository. You can also
                    use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to find all of the esideways@thecompany.com
                    email that occurred between specific dates and then make that email available
                    for review</li>

                <li class="li">As an administrator, you want to rid your networks and storage of unused data.
                    You can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to find all files that were not modified
                    in more than five years.</li>

                <li class="li">You want to find all image files that are created in 2007. Not only can IBM
                    StoredIQ Data Workbench find all image files that were created in 2007. It also
                    shows how much space they occupy on your network. </li>

                <li class="li">A user needs to understand how data about Windows is being retained. Using IBM
                    StoredIQ Data Workbench, you can provide that user with a visual overview of the
                    number of objects that are retained and a breakdown of files per data source.
                    Additionally, you can apply overlays to show the user if those files contain
                    forbidden information such as credit-card numbers or Social Security
                    numbers.</li>

                <li class="li">If IBM StoredIQ is configured accordingly, you can select the infosets and
                    filters that are published to the governance catalog for unified governance of
                    structured and unstructured information. When integrating with Information
                    Governance Catalog, you can also analyze and classify the data governed by IBM
                    StoredIQ based on the data classes that are synchronized from the governance
                    catalog. </li>
